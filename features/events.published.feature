Feature: Events
  In order to manage events
  As a client software developer
  I need to be able to update "isPublished" on events through the API.

  Background:
    Given the following users exist:
      | username   | password | roles          |
      | api-write  | apipass  | ROLE_API_WRITE |

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create an event
    When I authenticate as "api-write"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/events" with body:
    """
    {
      "name": "Event",
      "occurrences": [ { "startDate": "2000-01-01", "endDate": "2001-01-01" } ]
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON node "name" should be equal to "Event"
    And the JSON node "isPublished" should be true

  Scenario: Count Events
    When I authenticate as "api-write"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "GET" request to "/api/events?occurrences.startDate[after]=@0"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON node "hydra:member" should have 1 element

  Scenario: Unpublish event
    When I authenticate as "api-write"
